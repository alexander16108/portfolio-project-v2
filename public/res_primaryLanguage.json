The Rockets section displays a list of all available SpaceX rockets. Users can book each rocket by clicking the reservation button or cancel the previously made booking. The Missions section displays a list of current missions along with their brief description and participation status. There is also a button next to each mission that allows users to join the selected mission or leave the mission the user joined earlier. The My Profile section displays all reserved rockets and space missions.",
